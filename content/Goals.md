We at PSoc believe in *love for programming* and *community driven efforts.*

- to build a community of enthusiastic and dedicated coders who believe in learning and developing together.
- to inculcate healthy interactions and competition among all.
- to provide an active service learning group accessible to all.
- to create a positive workspace where queries are addressed well and encouragement serves as the driving force.
- to explore and encourage new technologies and ideas and provide a working ground for the same.
- to equip the community with enough resources to promote shared values and learning.
